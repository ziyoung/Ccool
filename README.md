# Ccool

Classroom Object-Oriented Language like C.

## Introduction

Ccool is inspired by [Cool language](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/). For most programmers,
they are more familiar with the C language.
So I want to develop a programming language that contains the features of the Cool language.

## Status

Working in progress. More features need to be added.
